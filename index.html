 <p>The problem is to design a system that is composed of a several devices connected in the series. Let <span class="math inline">\(r_{i}\)</span> be the reliability of the device <span class="math inline">\(D_{i}\)</span>. Then the Reliability of the entire system is <span class="math inline">\(\prod r_{i}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Even if the individual devices are very reliable, the reliabilty of the system may not be very good.</p>
<p>For example , if <span class="math inline">\(n=10\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_{i}=0.99\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\leq i\leq 10\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\prod r_{i}=0.904.\)</span>. Hence, it is desirable to duplicate the devices. Multiple copies of the same device type are connected in parallel through the use of switching circuits. The switching circuits determine which devices in any given group are functioning properly. They the make use of one such device at each stage. They then make use of one such device at each stage.</p>
